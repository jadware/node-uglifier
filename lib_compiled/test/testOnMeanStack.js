  //with mean stack there were multiple problems in 0.1.8

  //there were some fancy require statements where there were multiple parentheses after require like:
  //  require('./config/express')(db)
  //in this case the require AST node had the first argument (db) and not the actual path.
  //This has been resolved by giving precedence to the left most expression, that is the deeper in the parse tree

  //The other problem was naming files the same as modules like in the case of express.js
  //the logic assumed if a required file is found in the folder of the file in which the require statement is, than it is not module...
  //Clearly I did not mimick the behaviour of the node require well
  //This has been resolved by checking if there is / or \ in the require path argument, if not it is assumed to be module

  //On the other hand it has also dynamic require statements, which obviously will not work...
  // So this test tests only what supposed to work.
